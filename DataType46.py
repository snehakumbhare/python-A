#Python: Select the odd items of a list

#Write a  Python program to select the odd items from a list.
# Define a list 'x' containing numeric elements from 1 to 9
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Use slicing to create a new list containing every second element of 'x'
# The slice notation 'x[::2]' starts at the beginning, ends at the end, and steps by 2
# It selects every second element in the list
# Print the resulting list
print(x[::2])
