#Python: Convert a given list of strings and characters to a single list of characters

#Write a  Python program to convert a given list of strings and characters to a single list of characters.

# Define a function called 'l_strs_to_l_chars' that converts a list of strings and characters into a single list of characters.
def l_strs_to_l_chars(lst):
    # Use a nested list comprehension to create a new list 'result' where each character of the
    #input elements is a separate element in the list.
    result = [i for element in lst for i in element]
    return result

# Create a list 'colors' containing string and character elements.
colors = ["red", "white", "a", "b", "black", "f"]

# Print a message indicating the original list.
print("Original list:")
print(colors)

# Print a message indicating the intention to convert the list of strings and characters into a single list of characters.
print("\nConvert the said list of strings and characters to a single list of characters:")

# Call the 'l_strs_to_l_chars' function to perform the conversion and print the result.
print(l_strs_to_l_chars(colors))
