#Python: Remove and print every third number from a list of numbers until the list becomes empty

# Define a function named 'remove_nums' that takes a list 'int_list' as a parameter.

    position = 3 - 1

    # Continue removing elements until the list is empty.
    while len_list > 0:
        # Calculate the new index based on the starting position and current index.
        idx = (position + idx) % len_list
        # Print and remove the element at the calculated index.
        print(int_list.pop(idx))
